    <p class="border-box">What is the prompt I have been given? If you are writing a paragraph as a response or answer
        to a particular prompt, such as "You have decided to donate money to charity. Which charity do you choose and
        why?" or "Describe your favorite day of the week," you will need to think carefully about that prompt and make
        sure you are directly addressing it, rather than going off-topic.
        What are the main ideas or topics that I need to address? Think about the topic you are being asked or have
        decided to write about, and consider what the most relevant ideas or s relating to that topic are.
        As paragraphs are usually relatively short, it is important that you try to hit on all the main ideas, without
        going off-topic.
        Who am I writing for? Think about whom the intended readership of this paragraph or paper will be.
        What is their prior knowledge? Are they familiar with the topic at hand, or will it require many explanatory
        sentences?
        If your paragraphs are part of a larger essay, writing an essay outline can help you define the major ideas or
        goals of each paragraph.
